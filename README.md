# Useful-OpenCV-Scripts
A collection of useful OpenCV scripts. All of the code in this repo was written on OSX, and so might not work on Windows or Linux due to OpenCV incompatibilities.

Most of the scripts are based on the following tutorials:
- http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html
- http://www.pyimagesearch.com/
